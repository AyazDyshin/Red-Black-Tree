# Red-black tree implementation in C#
This is a semester project for Programming 2 (NPRG031) course.

The goal was to implement a red-black tree and compare its performance to an ordinary unbalanced tree.

The validity was checked by adding 1,000,000 random numbers into the tree, checking that it is valid, then deleting all the numbers and checking that the tree is empty.

Comparision was performed by inserting 10000 numbers in ascending orderer into both trees and then comparing the results.

The original date of submission is: 26.06.2019
